# IAA Support

## Overview
We leverage the power of Streamlit and Snowflake to analyze the output data from Snowpark Migration Accelator [(SMA)](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/migration-accelerator/). This repository contains all the required assets to deploy the Interactive Assessment Application (IAA) a streamlit app in your own Snowflake account, and analyze their workload in their own account.

Please find below the corresponding documentation:

- [Deployment](docs/Deployment.md)
- [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md)
